# PatternGenerator
Will generate a knitting pattern based on an Excel file used as input.

I created this code to take in my Excel-formatted knitting charts and automatically
output the charts as easy to copy/paste line-by-line instructions. This came up after having
created a set of 24 (well, 25 in the same file provided here, but 24 in my final pattern pack)
knitting patterns and finding the process of manually trying to count out the rows and write
the instructions manually too time consuming.

This code allows me to develop grid-formatted knit (and crochet!) patterns quickly
and easily. With the way the code is written, any number of characters could be used
for the grid - you could even use this to create a color-coded chart for knit or crochet.

Please note that the charts are read from the bottom up and from right to left. Also, the row counts
that are printed are based on knitting - I'll be developing some changes to the program to allow for
alternative read patterns and row printing.
